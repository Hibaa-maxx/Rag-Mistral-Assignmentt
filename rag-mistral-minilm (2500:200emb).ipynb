When considering the classification of a medicinal product as subject to restricted medical prescription, the following factors shall be taken into account\\n\\n. The medicinal product, because of its pharmaceutical characteristics or novelty or in the interests of public health, is reserved for treatments that can only be followed in a hospital environment;\\n\\n. The medicinal product is used in the treatment of conditions that must be diagnosed in a hospital environment or in institutions with adequate diagnostic facilities, although administration and follow-up may be carried out elsewhere; and\\n\\n.

Identifying medication errors and finding their underlying causes are the first steps in establishing prevention strategies to avoid their recurrence. In certain situations, medication errors are easily recognized by practitioners, but in other cases, medication errors are not clearly visible and are then reported as ADRs. In healthcare practice, the following are the most common methods used for the detection of medication errors namely: incident report review; patient chart review; direct observation; interventions by pharmacists; and\\n\\ntrigger tools.\\n\\nThe medication errors identified during the practice of healthcare professionals should be reported to the hospital pharmacovigilance center or NPC as the case may so that the recurrence of the same medication errors in\\n\\nother patients could be minimized.\\n\\n13. HIGH ALERT MEDICATIONS/ DRUGS LIST.\\n\\nHigh Alert Medications (HAMs) are medications that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patients harm when these medications/ drugs are used in error or inappropriately. The consequences of errors or inappropriate use of the following drugs can be more devastating and of serious concern. NPC, DRAP has developed a high alert medications/drugs list for Pakistan in collaboration with the Pakistan Society of Health- System Pharmacists (PSHP) that is available on the DRAP website. NPC, DRAP intends to encourage HCPs to actively monitor the safety of high alert medications/ drugs available on the list by avoiding their inappropriate use. If any adverse drug reaction (ADR) or ADE occur with or without inappropriate use, it should be managed properly and must be reported to National Pharmacovigilance Centre, DRAP through the available\\n\\nmeans.\\n\\nPage 23 of 37 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 26-04-2022\\n\\nAdverse Events Reporting Guidelines for Healthcare Professionals (Edition 01)\\n\\n14.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

The assessment criteria for the “possible” category are as under:\\n\\n= Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake \" Could also be explained by disease or other drugs = Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear\\n\\nFurther Explanation of the “possible” category: A \"possible\" ADR report may be explained by other drugs or diseases. Like a \"probable\" reaction, we have an event or a laboratory test abnormality with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake. Beyond that, there are several reasons for classifying a reaction as \"possible\". The suspected reaction could also be explained by other drugs the patient was taking. The disease might also be an explanation. For example, if we have a report of pancreatitis with a drug used to treat diabetes there is a problem because diabetes itself can lead to pancreatitis. Furthermore, a \"possible\" ADR report does not require dechallenge. Another reason for a \"possible\" classification is the lack of information about the outcome when the suspect drug was stopped, which is on dechallenge. In some cases that information will never be available. Stopping the suspect drug does not always lead to recovery even if it did cause the clinical event. Maybe it was so serious the patient died or was permanently harmed. Maybe the event was pregnancy due to an interaction with an oral contraceptive.\\n\\nThe pregnancy will of course continue even if the drug is stopped. 6.4.4 Unlikely. The assessment criteria for the “Unlikely” category are as under:\\n\\n= Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake\\n\\nthat makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible)\\n\\n= Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations.\\n\\nPage 63 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nFurther Explanation of “Unlikely” Category.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='For the Greater Good & in the Public Interest, Please Report ADRs to DRAP even if you are unsure.\\n\\nFor More Information/Queries, please contact:\\n\\nNational Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC), Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, Prime Minister’s National Health Complex, Park Road Islamabad.\\n\\nWebsite: www.dra.gov.pk Email: npo@dra gov.pk Phone No: 051-9255981\\n\\nFIRST FOLD HERE\\n\\nPage 100 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nANNEXURE B\\n\\nMed Vigilance E Reporting System (WHO E-Forms based) (For patient and healthcare professionals)\\n\\nMED Vigilance E Reporting System\\n\\nSelect language\\n\\nEnglish\\n\\nMED Vigilance E-Reporting System\\n\\nWelcome to DRAP MED Vigilance voluntary E-Reporting System.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

Industry E-Reporting (For Registration holders)\\n\\nThe DRAP in collaboration with the Uppsala Monitoring Centre has launched the industry e- reporting for submission of adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports by registration holders. Now registration holders will have to submit reports of ADRs/ICSRs through a manual data entry module or E2B upload module through this new tool of industry e-reporting. Industry e- reporting will allow the registration holders to carry out reporting, installation and operation of Pharmacovigilance, through the reporting of ADRs that occur nationwide with the medicine registered in their name, thus providing quality information in the reports. Access to this system is through secure logins, which will be provided to registration holders after submission of the application on pv@dra.gov.pk. Two user name accounts will be provided to each registration holder. For further details please go through “Industry E reporting Manuel’. Registration holders have to submit the ICSRs as per the timelines defined in\\n\\nPharmacovigilance Rules, 2022.\\n\\nRegistration holders of therapeutic goods can assess the Industry E reporting system through\\n\\nthe following link: https://industryereporting.who-umc.org/ F, CIOMS Form (For Registration holders)\\n\\nIn 1986, CIOMS set up its first Working Group on pharmacovigilance, a Working Group on International Reporting of Adverse Drug Reactions to explore means of coordinating and standardizing international adverse drug reporting by pharmaceutical manufacturers to'), Document(metadata={'source': 861}, page_content='7.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Identifying medication errors and finding their underlying causes are the first steps in establishing prevention strategies to avoid their recurrence. In certain situations, medication errors are easily recognized by practitioners, but in other cases, medication errors are not clearly visible and are then reported as ADRs. In healthcare practice, the following are the most common methods used for the detection of medication errors namely: incident report review; patient chart review; direct observation; interventions by pharmacists; and\\n\\ntrigger tools.\\n\\nThe medication errors identified during the practice of healthcare professionals should be reported to the hospital pharmacovigilance center or NPC as the case may so that the recurrence of the same medication errors in\\n\\nother patients could be minimized.\\n\\n13. HIGH ALERT MEDICATIONS/ DRUGS LIST.\\n\\nHigh Alert Medications (HAMs) are medications that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patients harm when these medications/ drugs are used in error or inappropriately. The consequences of errors or inappropriate use of the following drugs can be more devastating and of serious concern. NPC, DRAP has developed a high alert medications/drugs list for Pakistan in collaboration with the Pakistan Society of Health- System Pharmacists (PSHP) that is available on the DRAP website. NPC, DRAP intends to encourage HCPs to actively monitor the safety of high alert medications/ drugs available on the list by avoiding their inappropriate use. If any adverse drug reaction (ADR) or ADE occur with or without inappropriate use, it should be managed properly and must be reported to National Pharmacovigilance Centre, DRAP through the available\\n\\nmeans.\\n\\nPage 23 of 37 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 26-04-2022\\n\\nAdverse Events Reporting Guidelines for Healthcare Professionals (Edition 01)\\n\\n14.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

Dechallenge: the response to withdrawal, that is, dechallenge, and should be clinically reasonable. That is, the patient recovered after the drug was stopped or the dose reduced, within an expected period for the particular adverse reaction. Not applicable when irreversible tissue damage has occurred. Changes in tissue function might mimic natural disease so time to improvement follows natural evolution.\\n\\n6.4.3 Possible. The assessment criteria for the “possible” category are as under:\\n\\n= Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake \" Could also be explained by disease or other drugs = Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear\\n\\nFurther Explanation of the “possible” category: A \"possible\" ADR report may be explained by other drugs or diseases. Like a \"probable\" reaction, we have an event or a laboratory test abnormality with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake. Beyond that, there are several reasons for classifying a reaction as \"possible\". The suspected reaction could also be explained by other drugs the patient was taking. The disease might also be an explanation. For example, if we have a report of pancreatitis with a drug used to treat diabetes there is a problem because diabetes itself can lead to pancreatitis. Furthermore, a \"possible\" ADR report does not require dechallenge. Another reason for a \"possible\" classification is the lack of information about the outcome when the suspect drug was stopped, which is on dechallenge. In some cases that information will never be available. Stopping the suspect drug does not always lead to recovery even if it did cause the clinical event. Maybe it was so serious the patient died or was permanently harmed. Maybe the event was pregnancy due to an interaction with an oral contraceptive.\\n\\nThe pregnancy will of course continue even if the drug is stopped. 6.4.4 Unlikely. The assessment criteria for the “Unlikely” category are as under:\\n\\n= Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake\\n\\nthat makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible)\\n\\n= Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations.\\n\\nPage 63 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nFurther Explanation of “Unlikely” Category.'), Document(metadata={'source': 375}, page_content='15.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Identifying medication errors and finding their underlying causes are the first steps in establishing prevention strategies to avoid their recurrence. In certain situations, medication errors are easily recognized by practitioners, but in other cases, medication errors are not clearly visible and are then reported as ADRs. In healthcare practice, the following are the most common methods used for the detection of medication errors namely: incident report review; patient chart review; direct observation; interventions by pharmacists; and\\n\\ntrigger tools.\\n\\nThe medication errors identified during the practice of healthcare professionals should be reported to the hospital pharmacovigilance center or NPC as the case may so that the recurrence of the same medication errors in\\n\\nother patients could be minimized.\\n\\n13. HIGH ALERT MEDICATIONS/ DRUGS LIST.\\n\\nHigh Alert Medications (HAMs) are medications that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patients harm when these medications/ drugs are used in error or inappropriately. The consequences of errors or inappropriate use of the following drugs can be more devastating and of serious concern. NPC, DRAP has developed a high alert medications/drugs list for Pakistan in collaboration with the Pakistan Society of Health- System Pharmacists (PSHP) that is available on the DRAP website. NPC, DRAP intends to encourage HCPs to actively monitor the safety of high alert medications/ drugs available on the list by avoiding their inappropriate use. If any adverse drug reaction (ADR) or ADE occur with or without inappropriate use, it should be managed properly and must be reported to National Pharmacovigilance Centre, DRAP through the available\\n\\nmeans.\\n\\nPage 23 of 37 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 26-04-2022\\n\\nAdverse Events Reporting Guidelines for Healthcare Professionals (Edition 01)\\n\\n14.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2.

Dechallenge: the response to withdrawal, that is, dechallenge, and should be clinically reasonable. That is, the patient recovered after the drug was stopped or the dose reduced, within an expected period for the particular adverse reaction. Not applicable when irreversible tissue damage has occurred. Changes in tissue function might mimic natural disease so time to improvement follows natural evolution.\\n\\n6.4.3 Possible. The assessment criteria for the “possible” category are as under:\\n\\n= Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake \" Could also be explained by disease or other drugs = Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear\\n\\nFurther Explanation of the “possible” category: A \"possible\" ADR report may be explained by other drugs or diseases. Like a \"probable\" reaction, we have an event or a laboratory test abnormality with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake. Beyond that, there are several reasons for classifying a reaction as \"possible\". The suspected reaction could also be explained by other drugs the patient was taking. The disease might also be an explanation. For example, if we have a report of pancreatitis with a drug used to treat diabetes there is a problem because diabetes itself can lead to pancreatitis. Furthermore, a \"possible\" ADR report does not require dechallenge. Another reason for a \"possible\" classification is the lack of information about the outcome when the suspect drug was stopped, which is on dechallenge. In some cases that information will never be available. Stopping the suspect drug does not always lead to recovery even if it did cause the clinical event. Maybe it was so serious the patient died or was permanently harmed. Maybe the event was pregnancy due to an interaction with an oral contraceptive.\\n\\nThe pregnancy will of course continue even if the drug is stopped. 6.4.4 Unlikely. The assessment criteria for the “Unlikely” category are as under:\\n\\n= Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a time to drug intake\\n\\nthat makes a relationship improbable (but not impossible)\\n\\n= Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations.\\n\\nPage 63 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nFurther Explanation of “Unlikely” Category.'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='For the Greater Good & in the Public Interest, Please Report ADRs to DRAP even if you are unsure.\\n\\nFor More Information/Queries, please contact:\\n\\nNational Pharmacovigilance Centre (NPC), Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan, Prime Minister’s National Health Complex, Park Road Islamabad.\\n\\nWebsite: www.dra.gov.pk Email: npo@dra gov.pk Phone No: 051-9255981\\n\\nFIRST FOLD HERE\\n\\nPage 100 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nANNEXURE B\\n\\nMed Vigilance E Reporting System (WHO E-Forms based) (For patient and healthcare professionals)\\n\\nMED Vigilance E Reporting System\\n\\nSelect language\\n\\nEnglish\\n\\nMED Vigilance E-Reporting System\\n\\nWelcome to DRAP MED Vigilance voluntary E-Reporting System.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

Identifying medication errors and finding their underlying causes are the first steps in establishing prevention strategies to avoid their recurrence. In certain situations, medication errors are easily recognized by practitioners, but in other cases, medication errors are not clearly visible and are then reported as ADRs. In healthcare practice, the following are the most common methods used for the detection of medication errors namely: incident report review; patient chart review; direct observation; interventions by pharmacists; and\\n\\ntrigger tools.\\n\\nThe medication errors identified during the practice of healthcare professionals should be reported to the hospital pharmacovigilance center or NPC as the case may so that the recurrence of the same medication errors in\\n\\nother patients could be minimized.\\n\\n13. HIGH ALERT MEDICATIONS/ DRUGS LIST.\\n\\nHigh Alert Medications (HAMs) are medications that bear a heightened risk of causing significant patients harm when these medications/ drugs are used in error or inappropriately. The consequences of errors or inappropriate use of the following drugs can be more devastating and of serious concern. NPC, DRAP has developed a high alert medications/drugs list for Pakistan in collaboration with the Pakistan Society of Health- System Pharmacists (PSHP) that is available on the DRAP website. NPC, DRAP intends to encourage HCPs to actively monitor the safety of high alert medications/ drugs available on the list by avoiding their inappropriate use.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2.

The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Dechallenge: the response to withdrawal, that is, dechallenge, and should be clinically reasonable. That is, the patient recovered after the drug was stopped or the dose reduced, within an expected period for the particular adverse reaction. Not applicable when irreversible tissue damage has occurred. Changes in tissue function might mimic natural disease so time to improvement follows natural evolution.\\n\\n6.4.3 Possible. The assessment criteria for the “possible” category are as under:\\n\\n= Event or laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake \" Could also be explained by disease or other drugs = Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear\\n\\nFurther Explanation of the “possible” category: A \"possible\" ADR report may be explained by other drugs or diseases. Like a \"probable\" reaction, we have an event or a laboratory test abnormality with a reasonable time relationship to drug intake. Beyond that, there are several reasons for classifying a reaction as \"possible\". The suspected reaction could also be explained by other drugs the patient was taking. The disease might also be an explanation. For example, if we have a report of pancreatitis with a drug used to treat diabetes there is a problem because diabetes itself can lead to pancreatitis. Furthermore, a \"possible\" ADR report does not require dechallenge. Another reason for a \"possible\" classification is the lack of information about the outcome when the suspect drug was stopped, which is on dechallenge. In some cases that information will never be available. Stopping the suspect drug does not always lead to recovery even if it did cause the clinical event.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.
