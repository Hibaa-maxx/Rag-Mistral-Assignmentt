In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='(4) A manufacturer, importer or the seller of a drug shall sell the drug only to a holder of a valid drug sale licence or to a registered medical practitioner and shall issue an invoice and warranty at the time of sale of the drug.\\n\\n(5) In case of sale of a drug to a registered medical practitioner, the manufacturer, importer or seller of a drug shall send a copy of the invoice and warranty to the Inspector.\\n\\n(6) A registered medical practitioner or a doctor of veterinary medicine is exempted from the requirement of a drug sale licence, if:\\n\\n(a) _ the drug is for his patients; and\\n\\n(b) — the record of a drug specified in the Schedules B and D is maintained as prescribed under this rule.\\n\\nProvided that no pharmacy or medical store shall be allowed except and in accordance with the provisions of these rules.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='of the product could be found. 10.2.2. Pack size\\n\\nWe know that every pack size is specifically authorised for a medicinal product, planning the number of “dosage units” within each pack and the range of pack sizes available can be considered a form of routine risk management activity. Therefore, controlling the number of “dosage units” should mean that patients will need to see a healthcare professional at defined intervals, thus increasing the opportunity for testing and reducing the length of time a patient is without review. In extreme cases, making units available in only one pack size to try to link prescribing to the need for review may be considered. Likewise, small pack size can also be useful, especially if overdose or diversion\\n\\nare thought to be major risks. 10.2.3. Legal status\\n\\nControlling the conditions under which a medicinal product may be made available can reduce the risks associated with its use or misuse. The marketing authorisation must include details of any conditions or restrictions imposed on the supply or the use of the medicinal product, including the conditions under which a medicinal product may be made available to patients. Typically it includes information on whether or\\n\\nnot the medicinal product is subject to medical prescription.

The data collection may be undertaken by monitors who attend ward rounds, where they gather information concerning undesirable or unintended events thought by the attending physician to be (potentially) causally related to the medication. Monitoring may also be focused on certain major events that tend to be medicine-related such as hepatic disorders, renal failure, haematological disorders or bleeding. Intensive monitoring may be achieved by reviewing medical records or interviewing patients and/or physicians/pharmacists in a sample of sentinel sites to ensure complete and accurate data on reported adverse events. The selected sites may provide information, such as data from specific patient subgroups\\n\\nthat would not be available in a passive spontaneous reporting system. 5.2.2 Prescription/Drug Event Monitoring\\n\\nIn prescription event monitoring (PEM), patients may be identified from electronic prescription data or automated health insurance claims. A follow-up questionnaire can then be sent to each prescribing physician or patient at pre-specified intervals to obtain outcome information. Information on patient demographics, indication for treatment, duration of therapy (including start date), dosage, clinical events and reasons for\\n\\ndiscontinuation can be included in the questionnaire. PEM tends to be used as a method\\n\\nPage 50 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nto study safety just after product launch.

This characteristic can be a disease (disease registry) or a specific exposure (drug registry). Both types of registries, which only differ by the type of patient’s data of interest, can collect a set of information using standardised questionnaires in a prospective fashion. Disease registries, such as registries for blood dyscrasias, severe cutaneous reactions, or congenital malformations can help collect data on drug exposure and other factors associated with a clinical condition. Exposure (drug) registries address populations exposed to drugs of interest (e.g., registry of rheumatoid arthritis patients exposed to biological therapies) to determine if a drug has a special impact on this group of patients.

Now registration holders will have to submit reports of ADRs/ICSRs through a manual data entry module or E2B upload module through this new tool of industry e-reporting. Industry e- reporting will allow the registration holders to carry out reporting, installation and operation of Pharmacovigilance, through the reporting of ADRs that occur nationwide with the medicine registered in their name, thus providing quality information in the reports. Access to this system is through secure logins, which will be provided to registration holders after submission of the application on pv@dra.gov.pk. Two user name accounts will be provided to each registration holder. For further details please go through “Industry E reporting Manuel’.

Diluent that has been frozen should not be used because of the risk of crack in the vial/ampoule that may cause contamination. In addition, if diluent contains an active ingredient, the diluent may be damaged by freezing. If diluents are found to be frozen, an appropriate action should be taken to isolate and dispose the vials according to decision by NCLB.\\n\\nIn some countries, for freeze-dried vaccines, the protocol or certificate of analysis of the particular lot of diluent is reviewed. However, this is not done in other countries,\\n\\nsince diluents are not considered on their own to be biologicals. 21.5. Handling of Temperature Excursion\\n\\nAny temperature reading outside the ranges specified by the manufacturers is considered a temperature excursion. Manufacturer as well as the PRH should clearly understand what the consequences of temperature excursions are during product’s storage and transport from manufacturing site to Pakistan. It is the responsibility of manufacturer and PRH to assess if the available stability data are sufficient to address the potential temperature excursions. Additional studies shall be considered in the case where stability data is lacking. Stability data is crucial and contribute to support the\\n\\nrelease decision in case of temperature excursions.\\n\\n22. SAMPLE SUBMISSION\\n\\nProduct registration holder shall provide an appropriate number of finished products with diluents (if applicable), vials/ ampoules/ pre-filled syringes etc. Products can be delivered by self at the sample receiving area of NCLB or through the courier services by the applicant / product registration holder.\\n\\nMAH/ Applicants shall make sure that products submitted to NCLB, adhere to the approved storage temperature requirements. Appropriate temperature monitoring devices or indicators shall be attached together with the products in order to monitor temperature during transportation.

The NPC with the approval of PRAEC will develop a programme of inspection based on the human resources available. The results of an inspection will be provided to the registration holder who will be allowed to comment on any non-compliance identified.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes'), Document(metadata={'source': 1036}, page_content='6.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='of the product could be found. 10.2.2. Pack size\\n\\nWe know that every pack size is specifically authorised for a medicinal product, planning the number of “dosage units” within each pack and the range of pack sizes available can be considered a form of routine risk management activity. Therefore, controlling the number of “dosage units” should mean that patients will need to see a healthcare professional at defined intervals, thus increasing the opportunity for testing and reducing the length of time a patient is without review. In extreme cases, making units available in only one pack size to try to link prescribing to the need for review may be considered. Likewise, small pack size can also be useful, especially if overdose or diversion\\n\\nare thought to be major risks. 10.2.3. Legal status\\n\\nControlling the conditions under which a medicinal product may be made available can reduce the risks associated with its use or misuse. The marketing authorisation must include details of any conditions or restrictions imposed on the supply or the use of the medicinal product, including the conditions under which a medicinal product may be made available to patients. Typically it includes information on whether or\\n\\nnot the medicinal product is subject to medical prescription. It may also\\n\\nPage 71 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\nrestrict where the medicinal product can be administered (e.g. in a\\n\\nhospital) or by whom it may be prescribed (e.g. specialist).\\n\\nRestricted medical prescription\\n\\nThis may be used to control who may initiate treatment, prescribe the medicinal product and the setting (hospital or institutions having defined facilities etc) in which the medicinal product can be given or used.

The medicinal product, because of its pharmaceutical characteristics or novelty or in the interests of public health, is reserved for treatments that can only be followed in a hospital environment;\\n\\n.

The data collection may be undertaken by monitors who attend ward rounds, where they gather information concerning undesirable or unintended events thought by the attending physician to be (potentially) causally related to the medication. Monitoring may also be focused on certain major events that tend to be medicine-related such as hepatic disorders, renal failure, haematological disorders or bleeding. Intensive monitoring may be achieved by reviewing medical records or interviewing patients and/or physicians/pharmacists in a sample of sentinel sites to ensure complete and accurate data on reported adverse events. The selected sites may provide information, such as data from specific patient subgroups\\n\\nthat would not be available in a passive spontaneous reporting system. 5.2.2 Prescription/Drug Event Monitoring\\n\\nIn prescription event monitoring (PEM), patients may be identified from electronic prescription data or automated health insurance claims. A follow-up questionnaire can then be sent to each prescribing physician or patient at pre-specified intervals to obtain outcome information. Information on patient demographics, indication for treatment, duration of therapy (including start date), dosage, clinical events and reasons for\\n\\ndiscontinuation can be included in the questionnaire. PEM tends to be used as a method\\n\\nPage 50 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nto study safety just after product launch. In PEM, there is the opportunity to collect more\\n\\ndetailed information on adverse events from a large number of physicians and/or patients. 5.2.3 Registries\\n\\nA registry is a list of patients presenting with the same characteristic(s). This characteristic can be a disease (disease registry) or a specific exposure (drug registry). Both types of registries, which only differ by the type of patient’s data of interest, can collect a set of information using standardised questionnaires in a prospective fashion. Disease registries, such as registries for blood dyscrasias, severe cutaneous reactions, or congenital malformations can help collect data on drug exposure and other factors associated with a clinical condition. Exposure (drug) registries address populations exposed to drugs of interest (e.g., registry of rheumatoid arthritis patients exposed to biological therapies) to determine if a drug has a special impact on this group of patients.

In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='Further Explanation of the term “Probable” Category.\\n\\n1.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

For example; if during manufacturing of tablet dosage form, a powder mix & now you have to compress it but compression machine got out of order suddenly & it will take four days to repair. At this stage you should perform holding time studies for four days after testing the mix powder after four days to make sure that in case of any unwanted situation for how long your formulation (mix powder in this case) is stable if it is not processed further.

When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

Such inspections shall be carried out by Federal Drugs Inspectors and NPC officers appointed by the DRAP and empowered to inspect the premise and records; facilities and equipment; documentation and procedures; pharmacovigilance system master file (PSMF) and a sufficient number of trained and qualified staff; and other pertinent process/\\n\\ndocuments of registration holders in respect of pharmacovigilance system.\\n\\nA pharmacovigilance inspection may either be “routine inspections” scheduled according to a risk-based approach or “cause-specific inspections”, which have been triggered to examine suspected non-compliance by registration holder or potential risks, usually with impact on a specific product(s). The NPC with the approval of PRAEC will develop a programme of inspection based on the human resources available. The results of an inspection will be provided to the registration holder who will be allowed to comment on any non-compliance identified. If the outcome of the inspection is that the registration holder does not comply with the pharmacovigilance obligations, the NPC may take necessary measures to ensure that a registration holder is subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive\\n\\npenalties as determined by the PRAEC.\\n\\nPage 19 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n3.1.1.

Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information.

In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='of the product could be found. 10.2.2. Pack size\\n\\nWe know that every pack size is specifically authorised for a medicinal product, planning the number of “dosage units” within each pack and the range of pack sizes available can be considered a form of routine risk management activity. Therefore, controlling the number of “dosage units” should mean that patients will need to see a healthcare professional at defined intervals, thus increasing the opportunity for testing and reducing the length of time a patient is without review. In extreme cases, making units available in only one pack size to try to link prescribing to the need for review may be considered. Likewise, small pack size can also be useful, especially if overdose or diversion\\n\\nare thought to be major risks. 10.2.3. Legal status\\n\\nControlling the conditions under which a medicinal product may be made available can reduce the risks associated with its use or misuse.

The data collection may be undertaken by monitors who attend ward rounds, where they gather information concerning undesirable or unintended events thought by the attending physician to be (potentially) causally related to the medication. Monitoring may also be focused on certain major events that tend to be medicine-related such as hepatic disorders, renal failure, haematological disorders or bleeding. Intensive monitoring may be achieved by reviewing medical records or interviewing patients and/or physicians/pharmacists in a sample of sentinel sites to ensure complete and accurate data on reported adverse events. The selected sites may provide information, such as data from specific patient subgroups\\n\\nthat would not be available in a passive spontaneous reporting system. 5.2.2 Prescription/Drug Event Monitoring\\n\\nIn prescription event monitoring (PEM), patients may be identified from electronic prescription data or automated health insurance claims. A follow-up questionnaire can then be sent to each prescribing physician or patient at pre-specified intervals to obtain outcome information. Information on patient demographics, indication for treatment, duration of therapy (including start date), dosage, clinical events and reasons for\\n\\ndiscontinuation can be included in the questionnaire. PEM tends to be used as a method\\n\\nPage 50 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nto study safety just after product launch.

This characteristic can be a disease (disease registry) or a specific exposure (drug registry). Both types of registries, which only differ by the type of patient’s data of interest, can collect a set of information using standardised questionnaires in a prospective fashion. Disease registries, such as registries for blood dyscrasias, severe cutaneous reactions, or congenital malformations can help collect data on drug exposure and other factors associated with a clinical condition. Exposure (drug) registries address populations exposed to drugs of interest (e.g., registry of rheumatoid arthritis patients exposed to biological therapies) to determine if a drug has a special impact on this group of patients.

In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes')]\n\nQuestion: Which drugs are restricted to sale only with a prescription from a registered medical practitioner?\n\nAnswer: Drugs specified in the Schedules B and D and a preparation containing such drug shall not be sold except on and in accordance with the prescription (original to be retained by the pharmacy or the medical store) of a registered medical practitioner; a prescription may be dispensed with in case of an emergency (recorded in writing in the register); and no such prescription shall be required for sale of the drug to a registered medical practitioner, a hospital dispensary or any other institution.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":74},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Now finetuning with different weights, giving more weightage to FIASS!\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"retrievers = [bm25_retriever, faiss_retriever]\nweights = [0.3, 0.7] \n\nensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(retrievers=retrievers, weights=weights)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.398904Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.399855Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.404458Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.399815Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.403513Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":75},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Use local model (Mistral LLM)\nlocal_model = mistral_llm\nllm = local_model","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.742882Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.743711Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.747889Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.743668Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-17T10:15:59.746817Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":76},{"cell_type":"code","source":"QUERY_PROMPT = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"question\"],\n    template=\"\"\"\n    Generate 2 different versions of the given user question to retrieve relevant documents from a vector database.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

The results of an inspection will be provided to the registration holder who will be allowed to comment on any non-compliance identified.

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

They can also often be identified from the indications for the medicines the patient is taking, including the indication for the suspect medicine. Other drugs the patient was taking, the concomitants, should be considered. Is the clinical condition a recognised adverse reaction to any of them? If so, is there a reasonable time relationship with their intake in this case?

Aim of Educational Programme\\n\\nThe aim of an educational programme is to improve the use of medicine by positively influencing the actions of healthcare professionals and patients towards minimising risk. Ideally, educational materials should be available in a range of formats to ensure that access is not limited by disability or access to the internet. When feasible the appropriateness of the tool and media for the target audience (e.g. suitable language, pictures, diagrams, or other graphical support) should be user tested in advance, in order to optimise the success of the implementation phase. In the context of an educational programme, the tools can have several different target audiences, can address more than one safety concern and can be delivered using a combination of tools and media (e.g. paper,\\n\\naudio, video, web, in-person training). 10.4.2. Contents of Educational Programmes\\n\\nAny educational programme should be completely separated from promotional activities and contact information of physicians or patients gathered through educational programmes should not be used for promotional activities. The content of any educational material should be fully aligned with product information for a therapeutic good, such as the SmPC and PL, and should add rather than duplicate SmPC and PL information. Promotional elements, either direct or veiled (e.g. logos, product brand colours, suggestive images and pictures), should not be included and the focus of the educational material should be on the risk(s) related to the product and the management of those risk (s)\\n\\nrequiring additional risk minimisation.\\n\\nPage 74 of 81 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 14-04-2022\\n\\nGuidelines on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices for Registration Holders (Edition 01)\\n\\n10.4.3.

The records of purchase, import, dispensing, production, distribution and sale are to be kept at all levels and may be asked by the regulator at any time to avoid their misuse.

In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate. Additional risk minimisation activities/measures should only be introduced when they are deemed to be essential for the safe and effective use of the medicinal product\\n\\nand should be developed and provided by suitably qualified people.\\n\\nAdditional risk minimisation measures that may be considered in addition to\\n\\nthe routine measures include the following:\\n\\nv Educational programmes; Y Controlled access programmes; and\\n\\nv¥ Other risk minimisation measures\\n\\n10.4.Educational programmes'), Document(metadata={}, page_content='of the product could be found. 10.2.2. Pack size\\n\\nWe know that every pack size is specifically authorised for a medicinal product, planning the number of “dosage units” within each pack and the range of pack sizes available can be considered a form of routine risk management activity. Therefore, controlling the number of “dosage units” should mean that patients will need to see a healthcare professional at defined intervals, thus increasing the opportunity for testing and reducing the length of time a patient is without review. In extreme cases, making units available in only one pack size to try to link prescribing to the need for review may be considered. Likewise, small pack size can also be useful, especially if overdose or diversion\\n\\nare thought to be major risks. 10.2.3. Legal status\\n\\nControlling the conditions under which a medicinal product may be made available can reduce the risks associated with its use or misuse. The marketing authorisation must include details of any conditions or restrictions imposed on the supply or the use of the medicinal product, including the conditions under which a medicinal product may be made available to patients. Typically it includes information on whether or\\n\\nnot the medicinal product is subject to medical prescription.

The data collection may be undertaken by monitors who attend ward rounds, where they gather information concerning undesirable or unintended events thought by the attending physician to be (potentially) causally related to the medication. Monitoring may also be focused on certain major events that tend to be medicine-related such as hepatic disorders, renal failure, haematological disorders or bleeding. Intensive monitoring may be achieved by reviewing medical records or interviewing patients and/or physicians/pharmacists in a sample of sentinel sites to ensure complete and accurate data on reported adverse events. The selected sites may provide information, such as data from specific patient subgroups\\n\\nthat would not be available in a passive spontaneous reporting system. 5.2.2 Prescription/Drug Event Monitoring\\n\\nIn prescription event monitoring (PEM), patients may be identified from electronic prescription data or automated health insurance claims. A follow-up questionnaire can then be sent to each prescribing physician or patient at pre-specified intervals to obtain outcome information. Information on patient demographics, indication for treatment, duration of therapy (including start date), dosage, clinical events and reasons for\\n\\ndiscontinuation can be included in the questionnaire. PEM tends to be used as a method\\n\\nPage 50 of 108 Pharmacy Services Division Effective Date: 22-10-2024\\n\\nGuidelines on National Pharmacovigilance System (Edition 03)\\n\\nto study safety just after product launch.

This characteristic can be a disease (disease registry) or a specific exposure (drug registry). Both types of registries, which only differ by the type of patient’s data of interest, can collect a set of information using standardised questionnaires in a prospective fashion. Disease registries, such as registries for blood dyscrasias, severe cutaneous reactions, or congenital malformations can help collect data on drug exposure and other factors associated with a clinical condition. Exposure (drug) registries address populations exposed to drugs of interest (e.g., registry of rheumatoid arthritis patients exposed to biological therapies) to determine if a drug has a special impact on this group of patients.

In some exceptional cases, however, routine risk minimisation measures will not be sufficient for some risks and therefore additional risk minimisation measures will be necessary to manage the risk and/or improve the risk-benefit balance of a medicinal product. When additional risk minimisation activities are needed, safety concerns are to be prioritised in terms of frequency, seriousness, severity, impact on public health and preventability. Likewise, careful consideration is then to be given to whether the goal/aim can be reached with routine minimisation activities, and, if not considered sufficient, which additional minimisation measure(s) is (are) will be the most appropriate.
